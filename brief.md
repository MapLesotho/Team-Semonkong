#Semongkong Future Development

## Objectives:

1. Facilitate a greatly expanded population in the town making no impact on Agricultural land
2. Improve the amenity levels of the town, up to the standard of tourism
3. Use cumpulsory orders and enforcements to remove low value buildings from the town core
3. Maintain the character/history of the town, in particular the horse fairs and the animal husbandry

**There are other matters that need to be noted.**

1. **Road improvement**: <br>there is a committment to improve the road to Maseru at several junctures, meaning that people will be able to live in Semongkong and commute to Maseru. Currently the road takes 1 hour and 49 minutes to travel. This will be reduced.
2. **Tourism**: <br>the roads from the main road and town to the principle Tourist sites will be improved
3. **Accomodation**: <br>More "Government guesthouses" and private hotels within the town. This would be coupled with conference and meeting space
4. **The Airport**:<br>this is to be preserved, with a view to expansion
5. **Public Buildings**: <br>these will be clustered to add to the administrative presence in the town
6. **Population and Building Count**: <br>Expand the residential density to increase the number of residential buildings and population by 30% in a orderly way
7. Provide an informal space for a Licenced Market Bazaar
