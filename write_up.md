#Semongkong Analyis

##Definition of Area
The Community Council of Semongkong is positioned in the heartland of Lesotho, within Maseru District. It is positioned on the main east-west highway that connects Maseru to Qacha's Nek district. The area has some of Lesotho's better known Tourism settings. However, this is almost completely underdeveloped and the town has a very small scale rural character, serving mainly as a market town for a rural hinterland of 420 settlements. 
The brief demands that the town is developed in a significant way for expanded tourism use, and that the local population increases by 30%. There are therefore two areas for analysis:
- The Community Council of Semongkong composed of 13,500 hectares, the boundary being the formal administrative boundary
- The Market town of Semongkong composed of 1,850 hectares, the boundary being manually drawn in order to encompass all the development seen to be within the influence of Semongkong town

##Landuse and Land cover
The remaining community council area outside of the town is overwhelmingly rural farmland, and aside from Semongkong town there are no other towns in this community council area. This is borne out by the fact that over 11,000 hectares (or 86%) of the assigned landuse outside the town is tagged as "farmland". To a significant extent the residential land use of just over 1,623 hectares constitutes a nucleated and scattered series of very small human settlements. There are 420 such residential areas scattered among the farmland. Forestry is not abundant in the area with only 61 hectares (or 0.4%) indicated by the forest tag, so the available land is intensively used for Agriculture

Landuses in Semongkong town are somewhat different. Residential landuse is spread over 23 different areas. This, more than anything, shows the lack of urban coherence as a "town" considering the relatively small size of 1,850 hectares. However, what really points to a lack of coherence is that within the town the largest type of landuse is also "farmland" with over 68% of the area within the town being farmland. This could be caused by the fact that the town area has expanded due to unauthorised development at the edges, extending in a haphazard way into the farmland, rather than within any legible limits set by a formal planning strategy.  Whatever the cause the effect is to dilute the development of anything close to an urban character.

| landuse        | count N | hectares N | 
|----------------|-------|----------| 
| "cemetery"     | 2     | 0.769    | 
| "forest"       | 2     | 30.379   | 
| "farmland"     | 192   | 1273.081 | 
| "farmyard"     | 2     | 1.042    | 
| "construction" | 1     | 1.887    | 
| "residential"  | 23    | 544.766  | 

##Built Environment
Because there is very little ground based information in openstreetmap at this stage most 1878 buildings are still simply tagged as "building = yes". There is an appararnt lack of variety in buildings with only one industrial building to be found and only 11 sheds. The appearance of 96 "buildings = construction" are a good indication of development demand representing 4% of all buildings. This would be a moderate level of building construction. If these are the new buildings of Semongkong then we should anticipate that the built heritage is not changing, since they are around the same average size as all other buildings at 98 square metres. Another indication of continuity is the appearance of 435 Traditional Mekhoros (building = hut) which constitutes 18% of all the buildings in Semongkong Town. 
That there are only 2 buildings which are ruins suggests a high value places on sites, and a high demand for them for new construction.

More evidence of the different building types is needed here. 

| class          | count | total (sqm) |  mean (sqm) |

| "shed"         | 11    | 251         | 23          |

#Roads and ways
Roads are the only method of mobility within Semongkong since there is no evidence of river navigation or railway. Ase said previously the town is situated on the main Maseru to Qachas' Nek road. This road is a secondary road by the time it reaches Semongkong and 14kms of it traverses through the town. In recent years the main road was diverted away from the main street with the construction of a bypass which also serves as a road straightening.

Within the wider Semongkong Community Council area there are in total 1,507 kms of roads and paths of all kinds. Only 186km of these are situated within the Town of Semongkong. By far the most frequently occuring class of road is "track" with 75km in all, and these tends to exist at the town periphery, and joins roads to the rest of the rural hinterland. Residential class roads are then the next most frequent with 48kms. There are then quite a proliferation of paths totalling 27kms, though these are to be expected in urban areas and towns.
  
| class          | length(km) | 
|----------------|------------| 
| "secondary"    | 14.50      | 
| "unclassified" | 9.42       | 
| "track"        | 75.22      | 
| "service"      | 0.28       | 
| "path"         | 27.09      | 
| "tertiary"     | 11.40      | 
| "residential"  | 49.08      |
